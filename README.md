## Visual environment for designing interactive learning scenarios

This is the repository of the VEDILS project, which is a fork of MIT App Inventor 2. Project web is available on: http://vedils.uca.es/

The software has been created for supporting research on technologies for novice programmers. VEDILS is the result of a PhD thesis called **A method for the design, deployment and evaluation of extended educational scenarios based on visual programming** by José Miguel Mota, supervised by Juan Manuel Dodero and Iván Ruiz. Furthermore, this software contribution is described in the following papers:
